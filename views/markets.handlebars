		<p>Our story began in 2009 when we started to plant our roots in Pro AV. Recruiters at heart, we quickly made a name for ourselves by providing our clients with hard-to-find talent that included Sales Leadership, Control Systems Programmers, Design Engineers, Project Management, Estimators, Field Engineers, System Commissioners, and Lead Technicians. Our ability to understand the needs of our clients, and to deliver on them, made our story a successful one.</p>
		<p>For the past 10 years TPC has been a leader and pioneer in providing specialized personnel for the Pro AV Industry. Our business model has since expanded to include the ability to provide temporary or “contingent” technicians for our clients. Our technicians are almost always local to job sites – so we eliminate the need to spend money on extensive travel or lodging. Our technicians are qualified – we do our best to provide techs that match very closely to our clients’ job specs.</p>
